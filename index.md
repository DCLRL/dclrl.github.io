# Dataset Creation for Lower-Resourced Languages

# Workshop Description

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in developing datasets for lower-resourced languages and a greater involvement of the communities speaking those languages in the process. Developing resources for languages that have had fewer resources created for them poses a unique set of technical and ethical challenges that differs from higher-resourced language work.

The overall goal of the workshop is to create a new venue where previously disjoint research communities working on different areas surrounding lower-resourced languages can come together and share their insights across specialized research niches. We take an open and intersectional perspective to what might be called a “lower-resourced language,” acknowledging that this designation is both imperfect and often the result of many contributing factors.

Our workshop is deisgned to be open and inclusive, presenting great scholarship from as many different perspectives as possible, without endorsing a specific point of view on the workshop's topics.


# Call for Papers

## Topics

Papers submitted to the workshop are expected to generally revolve around resource creation for LRLs, but can otherwise be fairly broad in scope: for example, we welcome submissions describing both finished and planned/ongoing research projects, downloadable resources, and position papers containing insights on resource creation for lower-resourced languages that the broader community could benefit from. We are particularly interested in papers that discuss ethical issues, such as native speaker representation, that may arise when building resources for LRLs.

A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics for the workshop includes the following areas:

* Building monolingual/multilingual corpora for LRLs
* Leveraging online user-generated content when working with LRLs
* Efficient workflows for resource creation for LRLs
* Accounting for the typological diversity of LRLs
* Multimodal resources (text, audio, video) for LRLs
* Deployment and maintenance of language technology systems built on LRL resources
* Less traditional resources valued by LRL speakers
* Methods of collaboration with speakers of LRLs
* Ethical issues when working with LRLs

## Archival Submissions

We invite submissions of 4-8 page papers describing new resources for lower-resourced languages (LRLs), analyses of existing resources, advances in methodologies for constructing, curating, and using resources, and discussion of the challenges and ethical considerations of working with LRLs. Archival submissions will be included in the proceedings of the workshop in full.

We are currently finalizing our dates and CFP and will post them on April 8th, 2022.

## Non-archival Submissions

We will also accept submissions of extended abstracts for works-in-progress and submission of work published elsewhere (including the LREC main conference). These submissions will be not receive a full review process, but relevant, high-quality submissions will be listed in our proceedings and linked from our workshop website as relevenat work and we will include as many as possible in a poster session. We are still working out the details of this process and will post more information soon.

## Dates

* Submission deadline (archival): 4/18/2022
* Notification of acceptance: 5/3/2022
* Camera-ready submission: 5/23/2022
* Workshop:6/24/2022 (morning)


## Submission link

We are still configuring the submission system, please check back in after April 11th. (We will also specify the time zone on our submission deadline when the system is fully configured.)
