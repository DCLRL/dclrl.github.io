# The First Workshop on Dataset Creation for Lower-Resourced Languages

## LREC 2022 Workshop, June 24th, 2022, 9am-1pm


# Workshop Description

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in developing datasets for lower-resourced languages and a greater involvement of the communities speaking those languages in the process. Developing resources for languages that have had fewer resources created for them poses a unique set of technical and ethical challenges that differs from higher-resourced language work.

The overall goal of the workshop is to create a new venue where previously disjoint research communities working on different areas surrounding lower-resourced languages can come together and share their insights across specialized research niches. We take an open and intersectional perspective to the definition of a “lower-resourced language,” acknowledging that this designation is both imperfect and often the result of many contributing factors.

Our workshop is designed to be open and inclusive, presenting great scholarship from as many different perspectives as possible, without endorsing a specific point of view on the workshop's topics.

Like all of LREC, the workshop will be held in a hybrid fashion, with options for in-person and remote participation.

# Call for Papers

## Topics

Papers submitted to the workshop are expected to generally revolve around resource creation for LRLs, but can otherwise be fairly broad in scope: for example, we welcome submissions describing both finished and planned/ongoing research projects, downloadable resources, and position papers containing insights on resource creation for lower-resourced languages that the broader community could benefit from. We are particularly interested in papers that discuss ethical issues, such as native speaker representation, that may arise when building resources for LRLs.

A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics for the workshop includes the following areas:

* Building monolingual/multilingual corpora for LRLs
* Leveraging online user-generated content when working with LRLs
* Efficient workflows for resource creation for LRLs
* Accounting for the typological diversity of LRLs
* Multimodal resources (text, audio, video) for LRLs
* Deployment and maintenance of language technology systems built on LRL resources
* Less traditional resources valued by LRL speakers
* Methods of collaboration with speakers of LRLs
* Ethical issues when working with LRLs
* Position papers on anything related to LRLs, including what should be considered an LRL

## Submissions

We invite submissions of 4-8 page papers describing new resources for lower-resourced languages (LRLs), analyses of existing resources, advances in methodologies for constructing, curating, and using resources, and discussion of the challenges and ethical considerations of working with LRLs. Archival submissions will be included in the proceedings of the workshop in full.

Submissions must use the [LREC 2022 Template](https://lrec2022.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2022/authors-kit/) and be submitted as a PDF.
Following the LREC template, submission are non-anonymous and reviewing is single-blind.
References, acknowledgments, and ethical considerations/broader impact sections do not count toward the page limit.

A PDF-format appendix containing supplementary information (additional results, information for reproducibility, annotation guidelines, etc.) can also be submitted if desired.

## Dates

All deadlines are AoE (anywhere on Earth) time zone (UTC-12).

* Submission deadline (archival): 4/18/2022
* Notification of acceptance: 5/3/2022
* Camera-ready submission: 5/23/2022
* Workshop: 6/24/2022 (morning)
